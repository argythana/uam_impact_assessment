# Simple examples towards developing Sustainable Urban Air Mobility Indicators (SUAMI).

Personal hobby repository, inspired by the SIFAR-Med, the [Imafusa](https://www.imafusa-sesar.eu), and the [RefMAp](https://www.refmap.eu/) projects.
Capacity assessment in another repo. Perhaps, capacity could be done before or in parallel with impact assessment. 

Focusing on Impact Assessment helps identify areas where capacity assessment if a necessary precondition to maximise UAV potential.

## Impact type from different perspectives

* environmental impact (includes animal species too)
* economic impact
* social impact


## Methodological considerations
### Teke into account  assumptions about the "estimated" growth in polulation, plus urbanisation, plus economic growth, plus climate change, plus technological change.
This might be useful because it will help to identify the potential future impact of drones under changing conditions.
Also current means of transport are already operating under seriours constraints and limitations (e.g. cars in cities in terms of congestion and air pollution).
SOS: Impact on average and as a whole misses the whole point of exploring the areas, sectors, and regions where drones can have the most impact.
Perhaps, on the process of creating aggregates, it would be add a lot of value to identify areas where drones can have the most impact and then to assess the impact of drones in these areas and vice versa.


### Possible dimensions of Measuring impact.

A) Volume of impact (how much?)

* Subjective, perceptions impact (Note: subjective perceptions of reality matter). These may change dynamically.

* Strictly objective impact.


B) Comparative Assessment should identify the appropriate pairs to compare (more ore less?)
This requires metrics for the current existing other side of the pair.
B.1. Compare current drones with current conventional means.
B.2. Compare "future" drones with "future" conventional means.


C) Impact is different when assuming one to one substitution VS partial substitution. 
E.g. If delivery drones are more efficient and totally replace last-mile-delivery, will, ceteris paribus, the volume of last-mile-delivery increase?
* 

D) Quantitative comparison (measurable in volumes) may be a secondary consideration in life-saving situations.

E) Comparisons in volumes may be accompanied by descriptions of alternatives (e.g. ambulance noise or motorcycle exhaust noise).

F) Establishing use cases in ehich (under specific circumstances and scenaria, settings) absolute Pareto optimality holds.
Faster, greener, cheaper to use, cheaper to construct, cheaper recharge, more efficient, safer, more quiet, on demand, quicker RIO, less distance, easier repurpose/market-pivot.

G) Areas designated free of cars, may be also "free of drones", e.g. Parks.

H) What I did not see yet in the literature:
Parking-Storage Space for delivery drones versus parking-storage space for motorcycles. (size dimensions, area to store in sqm)
Noise pollution of drones versus noise pollution of motorcycles' exhaust noise.

I) Really nice gem in the literature: Animal "costumes", "shapes" for drones.

J) Disruptive Add-Ons: (my usually crazy ideas)
* Last-mile-delivery Drones Infrastructure:
** Build smart home delivery boxes on balconies as competitors to Pick-up boxes. Asynchronous home delivery (back to the future of the classical Post Office boexes)
** Potential for "smart" home delivery boxes to be used for other purposes (e.g. charging stations for drones, or for other electric vehicles).
** Potential to make owners of delievery boxes direct stakeholders in the ROI of drones adaption. Stakeholders not only directly as users but also as "investors" in the infrastructure.
A similar case is with first Solar panels on homes or with shop owners in the past with the first telephones, or current shop ownners with boxes for pick-up.
** Add small solar panels on home boxes of balconies and plugs for recharge. Give credits or monetary equivalents to users proportional to charging volume.

* Air-taxis to airports:
** Add check-in and AI identification services onboard of Air-taxis. Save time on both use ends. 
** Add distinct parking spaces on premises for VIP security control. Save time on both use ends.

## First Examples
Use scenaria from Safir-Med to compare the various metrics of the existing traditional means
Take into account [Safir-Med indicators framework](https://www.safir-med.eu/_files/ugd/4802dd_b6212dad758542f8bac152349ea9bd6e.pdf)
