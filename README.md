# Simple examples towards developing Sustainable Urban Air Mobility Indicators (SUAMI).

Personal hobby repository, inspired by the SIFAR-Med, the [Imafusa](https://www.imafusa-sesar.eu), and the [RefMAp](https://www.refmap.eu/) projects.
Capacity assessment in another repo. Perhaps, capacity could be done before or in parallel with impact assessment. 

Focusing on Impact Assessment helps identify areas where capacity assessment if a necessary precondition to maximise UAV potential.

## Impact type from different perspectives

* environmental impact (includes animal species too)
* economic impact
* social impact


## Methodological considerations

### Possible dimensions of Measuring impact.

A) Volume of impact (how much?)

* Subjective, perceptions impact (Note: subjective perceptions of reality matter). These may change dynamically.

* Strictly objective impact.


B) Comparative Assessment should identify the appropriate pairs to compare (more ore less?)
This requires metrics for the current existing other side of the pair.

C) Impact is different when assuming one to one substitution VS partial substitution. 
E.g. If delivery drones are more efficient and totally replace last-mile-delivery, will, ceteris paribus, the volume of last-mile-delivery increase?

D) Quantitative comparison (measurable in volumes) may be a secondary consideration in life-saving situations.

E) Comparisons in volumes may be accompanied by descriptions of alternatives (e.g. ambulance noise or motorcycle exhaust noise).

F) Establishing use cases in ehich (under specific circumstances and scenaria, settings) absolute Pareto optimality holds.
Faster, greener, cheaper to use, cheaper to construct, cheaper recharge, more efficient, safer, more quiet, on demand, quicker RIO, less distance, easier repurpose/market-pivot.

G) Areas designated free of cars, may be also "free of drones", e.g. Parks.

H) What I did not see yet in the literature:
Parking-Storage Space
Noise pollution of drones versus noise pollution of motorcycles' exhaust noise.

I) Really nice gem in the literature: Animal "costumes", "shapes" for drones.

J) Disruptive Add-Ons: (my usually crazy ideas)
* Last-mile-delivery Drones Infrastructure:
** Build samrt home delivery boxes on balconies as competitors to Pick-up boxes. Asynchronous home delivery (back to the future of the classical Post Office boexes)
** Add small solar panels on home boxes of balconies and plugs for recharge. Give credits or monetary equivalents to users proportional to charging volume.

* Air-taxis to airports:
** Add check-in and AI identification services onboard of Air-taxis. Save time on both use ends. 
** Add distinct parking spaces on premises for VIP security control. Save time on both use ends.

## First Examples
Use scenaria from Safir-Med to compare the various metrics of the existing traditional means
Take into account [Safir-Med indicators framework](https://www.safir-med.eu/_files/ugd/4802dd_b6212dad758542f8bac152349ea9bd6e.pdf)
